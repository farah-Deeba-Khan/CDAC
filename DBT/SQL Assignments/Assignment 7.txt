1) Write a query that counts all orders for October 3.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS order_count 
FROM Orders 
WHERE Odate = '1990-10-03';

2) Write a query that counts the number of different non-NULL city values in the
Customers table.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT City) AS unique_cities 
FROM Customers 
WHERE City IS NOT NULL;

3) Write a query that selects each customer’s smallest order.

SELECT Cnum, Cname, MIN(Amt) AS smallest_order 
FROM Customers 
JOIN Orders ON Customers.Cnum = Orders.Cnum 
GROUP BY Customers.Cnum, Customers.Cname;

4) Write a query that selects the first customer, in alphabetical order, whose name
begins with G.

SELECT *

FROM Orders 
GROUP BY Odate;
